  "outputs": [
    "Code and config updates describing exact hunks, commands run, and the resulting rationale.",

    "Terminal commands (tests, linters): describe and run them via the workspace shell when required."
  ],
  "workflow": [
    "Reconfirm the task context via tasks.json and tasks.md so the ID, owner, and acceptance criteria match the current plan.",
    "Draft a brief numbered mini-plan if the work spans multiple files or logical steps, referencing @files so Codex can open them directly.",
    "Apply edits with before → after snippets tied to @mentions, ensuring every permissioned file change stays within the current workspace.",
    "When a command (test, formatter, lint) is needed, spell it out, run it via the workspace terminal, and summarise the key output lines without dumping entire logs.",
    "Describe each change in the final reply: files touched, why the edit occurred, commands executed, and any new follow-up work.",
    "Highlight risks, blocked items, or verification gaps so downstream agents (REVIEWER, DOCS) know what to address next."
