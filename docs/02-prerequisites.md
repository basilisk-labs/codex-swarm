# Prerequisites

## Required
- Git (any recent version).
- Python 3.10+ to run `python .codex-swarm/agentctl.py`.
- OpenAI Codex plugin in your IDE (Cursor, VS Code, JetBrains).

## Recommended
- A terminal with `zsh` or `bash`.
- Familiarity with git status, add, and commit.

## Environment Assumptions
- The repo is local and opened in your IDE.
- There are no remote runtimes; commands run on your machine.
- Edits outside the repo require explicit approval.

## Backend Dependencies
- Local backend: no extra requirements beyond the repo.
- Redmine backend: network access and a backend plugin config with API credentials.

## Notes
- If `python` is not available, use `python3` for agentctl commands.

## Planned Expansions
- Add a short checklist for Redmine API access and required custom fields.
