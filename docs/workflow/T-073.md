# T-073: Reduce integrate noise: auto-sync PR meta head_sha

## Goal

- Speed up the local branch_pr pipeline by removing the common `integrate` warning about stale PR `meta.json` `head_sha`, while keeping PR artifacts accurate on `main`.

## Scope

- `scripts/agentctl.py`:
  - During `integrate`, treat the task branch HEAD SHA as authoritative (instead of warning).
  - After merge, ensure `docs/workflow/prs/T-###/meta.json` on `main` reflects the correct `head_sha` and `last_verified_sha` for the integrated branch head.
- No changes to task branches (single-writer PR artifacts remain owned by the task branch until merge).

## Verification

- `python -m compileall scripts/agentctl.py`
- `python scripts/agentctl.py task lint`
- Manual smoke: run `integrate` on a task branch whose PR `meta.json` is stale and confirm no warning is emitted and the merged PR `meta.json` is corrected on `main`.
