# T-062: Refresh project documentation + cleanup

## Goal

- Bring project documentation in sync with the current codebase and workflows (agentctl-driven task ops, JSON agent registry, and commit/verification cadence), and ensure `clean.sh` removes framework-development artifacts while keeping the minimal runtime needed to reuse the framework.

## Scope

- Update root docs to match current repo structure and behavior:
  - `README.md`
  - `GUIDELINE.md`
  - `CONTRIBUTING.md`
  - `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md`
- Restructure long-form “how it works” content into `docs/architecture.md` and link from `README.md`.
- Update `clean.sh` to:
  - remove framework-development artifacts and local dev leftovers,
  - preserve `docs/agentctl.md` when present,
  - recreate an empty, checksum-valid `tasks.json`,
  - stage the right minimal file set after `git init`.

## Verification

- `bash -n clean.sh`
- `python scripts/agentctl.py task lint`
