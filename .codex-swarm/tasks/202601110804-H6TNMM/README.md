## Summary

Remove legacy T-### compatibility and task reid helpers, align branch/worktree parsing with timestamp IDs, and backfill commit metadata so lint passes.

## Context

We no longer need legacy T-### branches or task reid; branch_pr mode should only accept timestamp IDs. Lint was failing because early DONE tasks lacked commit metadata; backfill required.

## Scope

- Remove legacy branch parsing and task reid logic from agentctl; rely on timestamp IDs only.
- Simplify clean.sh scrubbing to stop rewriting examples to T-###.
- Backfill commit metadata for all DONE tasks and regenerate tasks.json so lint passes.

## Risks

- Removing legacy parsing could block users still on old T-### branches (not expected per request).
- Bulk backfill touches many README files; git history noise.

## Verify Steps

- python .codex-swarm/agentctl.py task lint

## Rollback Plan

- Revert agentctl/clean.sh and tasks README backfill commits.

## Notes

- Owner warnings for 'AUTOMATION' remain; acceptable as lint warnings.
