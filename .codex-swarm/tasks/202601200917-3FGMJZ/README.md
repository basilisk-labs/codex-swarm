## Summary

Document the global recipes bundle format and CLI usage.

## Context

Users need to know how to build the bundle and how to read summary vs recipe details.

## Scope

- Add global bundle section to RECIPES.md.
- Document bundle build and bundle show commands.

## Risks

Docs could drift from CLI behavior if examples are inaccurate.

## Verify Steps

Review RECIPES.md for accuracy and English-only wording.

## Rollback Plan

Revert RECIPES.md changes.
