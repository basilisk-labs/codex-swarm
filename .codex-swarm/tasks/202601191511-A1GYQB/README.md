## Summary

Delivered the recipes CLI, global prompt rules, and documentation wiring for Codex Swarm recipes.

## Context

Top-level tracking task covering analysis, CLI implementation, docs updates, and integration closure for recipes.

## Scope

Subtasks completed: QN0W0P analysis, 0AWCPY CLI implementation, 6ZKD5S docs wiring, BZPKM2 integration.

## Risks

Residual risk: recipe manifest validation is minimal and may need stricter schema checks later.

## Verify Steps

CLI help command executed; documentation reviewed for recipe references.

## Rollback Plan

Revert the recipes CLI and documentation commits if the feature set needs to be removed.

## Notes

Recipes CLI lives at .codex-swarm/recipes.py; prompt rules in .codex-swarm/RECIPES.md.
