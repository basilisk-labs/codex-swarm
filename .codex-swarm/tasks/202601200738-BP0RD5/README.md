description: "Document the core vs recipes backend strategy (local backend stays in core; remote backends via recipes) and define the mini-CLI contract for recipe tools, aligned with agentctl-style outputs and errors."
---
## Summary

Documented the recipe mini-CLI contract and clarified the core/local backend strategy in the docs.

## Context

Needed to codify the minimal core (local backend) and require recipe tools to expose a formal mini-CLI interface.

## Scope

Updated AGENTS.md with the local-backend core rule; added a recipe mini-CLI contract and structured output format in RECIPES.md; noted backend strategy in docs/07-tasks-and-backends.md.

## Risks

Documentation changes may need alignment as recipe tooling evolves; enforce the mini-CLI contract in future recipe implementations.

## Verify Steps

Reviewed the updated documentation sections for consistency with core and recipe guardrails.

## Rollback Plan

Revert commit c9a7cc449afd to remove the documentation updates.

## Notes

Mini-CLI JSON output format is now documented in RECIPES.md and should be used for new recipe tools.
