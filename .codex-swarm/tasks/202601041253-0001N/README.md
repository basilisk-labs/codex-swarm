description: "Change DOCS agent behavior so it runs before finishing any task and produces an atomic documentation artifact under @docs/workflow (e.g., @docs/workflow/T-025.md) describing what was implemented. Update orchestration guidance so plans include DOCS before REVIEWER marks tasks DONE.\\\\n\\\\nAcceptance criteria:\\\\n- @docs/workflow directory exists and is committed (with a short README describing artifact convention).\\\\n- @.AGENTS/DOCS.json instructs producing @docs/workflow/T-###.md artifacts (English, atomic, task-scoped).\\\\n- @AGENTS.md ORCHESTRATOR guidance schedules DOCS before finishing any task (DOCS before REVIEWER finish).\\\\n\\\\nNotes:\\\\n- Artifacts must be task-ID named, contain summary + changed files + verification commands (when available)."
