## Summary

Rewrote the roadmap recipe documentation and input schemas in English, aligned them to roadmap outputs, and documented recipe layout and inventory usage.

## Context

Standardized the feature-spec-to-tasks recipe to focus on roadmap generation and ensured documentation matches current recipe formats and policies.

## Scope

Updated recipe README, scenarios, and input schemas; documented recipe layout and inventory generation in RECIPES.md; added commands note in docs/09-commands.md.

## Risks

Documentation can drift if the runner or manifest changes; the inventory list must be regenerated after recipe updates.

## Verify Steps

Reviewed updated recipe docs and schemas; confirmed the recipes scan command is documented for the inventory list.

## Rollback Plan

Revert commit f91c90b84720 to restore the prior documentation and schemas.

## Notes

Documentation-only changes; no runtime behavior updates in this task.
