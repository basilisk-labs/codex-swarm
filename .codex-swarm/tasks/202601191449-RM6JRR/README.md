## Summary

Standardized task priority labels to the core set and aligned status wording in docs.

## Context

The repo had mixed priority labels (med/Нормальный) that needed normalization to the standard scheme.

## Scope

- Normalize task priorities to low/normal/high across task docs and export.
- Update docs wording to reference the standard status labels.

## Risks

- Mislabeling priorities could affect reporting expectations if consumers assumed legacy labels.

## Verify Steps

- N/A (doc-only normalization).

## Rollback Plan

- Revert the commits linked in task metadata to restore prior labels.

## Notes

- Status wording in README/agentctl docs now references TODO instead of Backlog.
