# Summary

Clarified agent instructions so commit messages use only the unique task index (suffix after the last dash) and omit the timestamp portion.

# Scope

- Update agent workflow guidance to standardize commit message indexing.

# Risks

- Low risk: guidance-only change; impact is limited to commit message formatting.

# Verify Steps

- None (documentation-only).

# Rollback Plan

- Revert the agent instruction change if the commit naming convention needs to include timestamps again.
