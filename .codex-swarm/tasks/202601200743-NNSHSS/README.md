## Summary

Defined migration steps and dependencies for moving Redmine backend functionality into a recipe.

## Context

We want optional Redmine integration without core backend coupling, using recipe-managed enable/disable flows.

## Scope

1) Extract redmine backend files into recipe payload (backend.py, backend.json).\n2) Add recipe runner (mini-CLI) with install/disable/status/sync/verify commands.\n3) Update docs to point to recipe enable/disable and remove redmine backend from core listing.\n4) Validate that local backend remains default; update config via agentctl during install/disable.\n5) Add recipe to inventory and provide sample inputs schema.\nDependencies: recipe spec (202601200743-6CQN5R) before implementation; docs update after runner is in place.

## Risks

Migration can break existing Redmine users if install/disable flows are not robust; ensure fallback to local backend is reversible and documented.

## Verify Steps

Review the migration steps with the recipe spec to ensure all required backend behaviors are covered.

## Rollback Plan

Keep core local backend untouched; re-enable local backend via recipe disable command or config reset if migration fails.

## Notes

Implementation task should include updating docs/12-redmine.md to point to the recipe enable/disable workflow.
