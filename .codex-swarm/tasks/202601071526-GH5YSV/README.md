## Summary

Make README onboarding clearer for newcomers by explaining the ORCHESTRATOR prompt flow and mentioning clean.sh.

## Context

New users struggle to understand how to start with the ORCHESTRATOR prompt and when to use clean.sh. The README getting-started section needs clearer guidance for the direct workflow.

## Scope

- Clarify the initial ORCHESTRATOR prompt and approval expectations in README.
- Add newcomer-friendly steps to Getting Started.
- Mention clean.sh as an optional reset tool and when to use it.

## Risks

- Over-explaining could clutter the README and bury key steps.
- Guidance must stay aligned with both direct and branch_pr workflows.

## Verify Steps

- (Docs) Proofread updated README copy.

## Rollback Plan

- Revert the README onboarding edits.

## Notes

- Keep examples consistent with the active workflow_mode guidance.
