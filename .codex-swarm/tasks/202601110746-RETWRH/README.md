## Summary

Fix corrupted task README metadata and populate missing sections so task docs pass PR checks.

## Context

Task 202601071438-C7W2GE frontmatter is malformed (`Яstatus`) and contains escaped newlines, so the backend reads it as TODO. Task 202601071526-GH5YSV lacks body sections entirely, causing future PR checks to fail. Both need cleanup via agentctl.

## Scope

- Rewrite C7W2GE frontmatter via agentctl so status=DONE is respected and docs render correctly.
- Replace escaped `\n` bullets in C7W2GE with proper Markdown list items.
- Populate GH5YSV task README sections (Summary/Context/Scope/Risks/Verify Steps/Rollback Plan/Notes).

## Risks

- Manual doc updates could misrepresent task status if fields are missed.
- PR checks may still fail if required sections remain empty.

## Verify Steps

- python .codex-swarm/agentctl.py task lint

## Rollback Plan

- Revert the README changes for C7W2GE and GH5YSV.

## Notes

- Do not change task ownership/status beyond correcting the corrupted frontmatter.
