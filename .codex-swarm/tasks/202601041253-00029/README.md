description: "Speed up the pipeline by removing the common integrate warning about stale PR meta head_sha. Acceptance: (1) python scripts/agentctl.py integrate no longer prints \\\"PR meta head_sha differs\\\" in normal usage; (2) integrate uses the actual task branch HEAD SHA for verify and writes it into docs/workflow/prs/T-###/meta.json on main (head_sha + last_verified_sha) so artifacts stay consistent; (3) safe in workflow_mode=branch_pr and never writes to the task branch; (4) meta.json ends up correct after integration."
