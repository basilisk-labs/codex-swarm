---
## Summary

Update ORCHESTRATOR workflow to refresh bundles via recipes.py refresh when a bundle exists.

## Context

Auto-refresh should be explicit and code-backed, without implying implicit tool execution.

## Scope

- Replace scan+compile-only guidance with scan+refresh (fallback to compile).
- Keep confirmation requirement for any tool execution.

## Risks

The workflow change could be misread as implicit execution; wording must remain explicit.

## Verify Steps

Review ORCHESTRATOR.json for the updated refresh guidance.

## Rollback Plan

Revert ORCHESTRATOR.json.

## Notes

No runtime behavior changes beyond documented workflow.
