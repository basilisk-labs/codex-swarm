## Summary

Delivered the roadmap recipe overhaul, including English docs, standardized inputs/outputs, a working runner, and refreshed recipe inventory.

## Context

Required to formalize recipe formats and ensure the roadmap recipe truly generates detailed roadmap artifacts with standard env vars.

## Scope

Coordinated doc/schema updates, manifest and runner implementation, and recipe catalog refresh across the roadmap recipe.

## Risks

Recipe documentation can drift as formats evolve; inventory must be regenerated after manifest changes.

## Verify Steps

Reviewed subtask outputs; ran recipes scan and the roadmap runner with sample inputs to validate artifact creation.

## Rollback Plan

Revert commits f91c90b84720 and cdb841383165 to undo the docs and runner changes; regenerate the inventory as needed.

## Notes

Subtasks completed: 202601200542-E5CDTX (docs), 202601200542-534F3X (runner and manifest).
