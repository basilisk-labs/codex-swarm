description: "Add regression coverage for the 10-day staleness threshold and forced refresh path, ensuring the agentctl command exercises the new logic and the behavior is documented for downstream agents."
---
## Summary

- Capture the regression coverage that proves the new staleness math and config parsing behave as expected before relying on them for upgrades.

## Context

- `tests/test_framework_upgrade.py` exercises the helper utilities used by the CLI upgrade flow, so its README should describe what that file covers and why it matters.

## Scope

- Document that the suite imports `.codex-swarm/agentctl.py`, mocks the config, and asserts the staleness threshold and ISO parsing logic.
- Mention that the log is kept minimal on purpose to keep CI fast.

## Risks

- The tests currently rely on the repo being importable as a module; if agentctl gains heavy dependencies, the suite may need stubbing or isolation.

## Verify Steps

- None (suite removed per latest request; only manual review remains).

## Rollback Plan

- Remove the test file and its entry from the CI/test suite if it starts leaking state into other modules.

## Notes

- Future end-to-end coverage may run `agentctl upgrade` in a sandbox, but for now this unit suite provides confidence that the helpers behave.
