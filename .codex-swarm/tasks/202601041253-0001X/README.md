description: "Update agent workflows so that before creating the final closure commit for a task (the commit that marks the task DONE in tasks.json, typically together with docs/workflow/T-###.md updates), the agent must explicitly request user confirmation and wait for approval.\\\\n\\\\nAcceptance criteria:\\\\n- AGENTS.md COMMIT_WORKFLOW states that the final closure commit requires explicit user approval.\\\\n- ORCHESTRATOR guidance includes a pause/confirmation request before the closing commit.\\\\n- REVIEWER workflow requires asking the user before running agentctl finish + committing tasks.json (and any workflow artifact updates)."
