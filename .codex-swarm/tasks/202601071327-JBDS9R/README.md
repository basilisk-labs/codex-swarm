description: "Minimize repeated snapshot mentions across AGENTS.md and agent JSONs by centralizing the rule and pointing to agentctl.md for details; keep only a single explicit 'do not edit snapshot' rule."
---
## Summary

- Centralized snapshot/export rules in @AGENTS.md.
- Removed snapshot wording from agent role specs, relying on agentctl guidance.
- Simplified workflow wording to avoid repeated export references.

## Goal

- Keep snapshot handling centralized with a single explicit rule and agentctl references.

## Scope

- @AGENTS.md
- @.codex-swarm/agents/*.json

## Risks

- Low: reduced wording may require cross-check if new docs add snapshot references.

## Verify Steps

- None (doc/instruction changes only).

## Rollback Plan

- Revert commit `7d60d437aba0`.
