description: "Update agent workflows so they avoid extra commits beyond what is necessary. Target a default 3-commit cadence per task:\\\\n1) Planning: add the task + create initial workflow artifact @docs/workflow/T-###.md (skeleton/spec).\\\\n2) Implementation: implement the change set (preferably including tests) in a single work commit.\\\\n3) Verification/closure: run tests + review, update the workflow artifact with what was implemented, and mark the task DONE (tasks.json) in one final commit.\\\\n\\\\nAcceptance criteria:\\\\n- @AGENTS.md COMMIT_WORKFLOW reflects the 3-commit default and explicitly discourages extra 'start/status' commits.\\\\n- Agent prompts (.AGENTS/*.json) align: TESTER does not commit by default; DOCS artifacts are committed as part of planning/closure; REVIEWER closes tasks with a single final commit; CODER bundles implementation+tests into one work commit where practical.\\\\n- Existing guardrails (agentctl) remain usable (finish may reference the implementation commit hash)."
