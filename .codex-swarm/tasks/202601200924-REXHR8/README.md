## Summary

Connect agents to the global recipes bundle via CLI summary and per-recipe views.

## Context

Agents need a standard discovery path for available recipes and detailed docs.

## Scope

- Add bundle read guidance to AGENTS.md and RECIPES.md.
- Update ORCHESTRATOR workflow to read bundle summary and per-recipe docs.

## Risks

Docs could be misread as implicit execution; keep explicit confirmation language.

## Verify Steps

Review AGENTS.md, RECIPES.md, and ORCHESTRATOR.json for consistency.

## Rollback Plan

Revert docs and workflow changes.
