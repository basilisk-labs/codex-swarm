# Summary

Clarify PLANNER instructions to always review existing tags, apply the minimal set for navigation, and set dependencies when possible when creating tasks.

# Scope

- Update PLANNER workflow guidance to enforce tag review/minimal tagging and dependency hints.

# Risks

- Low risk: guidance-only change; risk is limited to behavior alignment.

# Verify Steps

- None (documentation-only).

# Rollback Plan

- Revert the PLANNER instruction change if it causes confusion or conflicts with existing workflows.
