## Summary

Implement a global recipes bundle CLI that aggregates all recipes with context and allowed commands.

## Context

Agents need a single bundle to know available recipes, scenarios, tools, and context without loading per-scenario bundles.

## Scope

- Add recipes.py bundle build/show commands.
- Aggregate per-recipe context snapshots, tools, and scenario docs.
- Default output to .codex-swarm/recipes/bundle.json (not committed).
- Ignore the bundle file in .gitignore.

## Risks

Global bundle size may grow; ensure context limits are enforced and errors are clear.

## Verify Steps

Review recipes.py help and bundle build output structure.

## Rollback Plan

Revert recipes.py and .gitignore changes.

## Notes

No tool execution; bundle is metadata only.
