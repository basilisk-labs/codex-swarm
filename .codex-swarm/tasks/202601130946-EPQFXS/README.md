## Summary

Deduplicate agent JSON instructions to role-specific content and add batch task add/finish guidance.

## Context

Agent JSON files repeated common workflow rules; centralizing shared guidance in AGENTS.md and agentctl.md reduces prompt duplication. Batch task operations encourage write_tasks usage to reduce repeated writes.

## Scope

- Simplify .codex-swarm/agents/*.json to role-specific guidance with references to AGENTS.md and .codex-swarm/agentctl.md.
- Add batch task add/finish guidance in AGENTS.md and .codex-swarm/agentctl.md.

## Risks

Over-trimming could remove role-specific constraints; ensure shared rules remain in AGENTS.md and agentctl.md.

## Verify Steps

Manual: review agent JSONs for role-specific content and confirm batch guidance appears in AGENTS.md and .codex-swarm/agentctl.md.

## Rollback Plan

Revert the AGENTS.md, .codex-swarm/agentctl.md, and .codex-swarm/agents/*.json changes.

## Notes

Documentation-only change; no runtime behavior updates.
