## Summary

Audited the Redmine backend and defined the recipe-based replacement plan with scenarios, inputs, and migration steps.

## Context

Goal: move Redmine backend into a recipe so it is optional and user-enabled, while keeping local backend in core.

## Scope

Reviewed current Redmine backend implementation (.codex-swarm/backends/redmine/backend.py, backend.json) and agentctl sync behavior. Defined recipe specification (202601200743-6CQN5R) and migration steps (202601200743-NNSHSS).

## Risks

Redmine backend migration requires careful handling of config and custom fields; recipe must enforce safe defaults and explicit confirmation for sync push.

## Verify Steps

Reviewed redmine backend code and agentctl sync command behavior; confirmed recipe plan covers install/disable/sync/verify flows.

## Rollback Plan

Leave core local backend untouched; migration can be abandoned by keeping local backend config and not installing the recipe payload.

## Notes

Next step is implementing the redmine-backend recipe and updating docs/12-redmine.md to reference it.
