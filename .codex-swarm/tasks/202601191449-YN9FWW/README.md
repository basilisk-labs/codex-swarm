## Summary

Normalized task priority indicators and aligned status wording in docs.

## Context

Priority indicators were inconsistent (med/Нормальный) and docs used mixed status labels.

## Scope

- Standardize priorities to low/normal/high across tasks.
- Update docs to reference TODO instead of Backlog in workflow wording.

## Risks

- Consumers relying on legacy labels may need to update their expectations.

## Verify Steps

- N/A (documentation and metadata normalization).

## Rollback Plan

- Revert commits in task metadata to restore the previous labels.

## Notes

- No task status changes were made; only labels were normalized.
