## Summary

Defined the core minimum agent/task workflow and updated recipe rules to allow tools by default and permit agentctl usage under guardrails.

## Context

Needed to formalize the minimal core behavior while shifting extensions into recipes and loosening tool/agentctl permissions for recipe scenarios.

## Scope

Updated AGENTS.md to add a core-minimum section and recipe-driven agentctl allowance; updated RECIPES.md to allow tools by default and to permit agentctl usage with confirmation.

## Risks

Allowing recipe-driven agentctl use increases risk of misuse; strict confirmation and guardrails must be enforced in scenarios.

## Verify Steps

Reviewed AGENTS.md and RECIPES.md updates for consistency with guardrails and recipe policies.

## Rollback Plan

Revert commit 6a935ba8cde9 to restore the previous core minimum and recipe permission rules.

## Notes

Tools are still explicit; only the default allowance changed, not the confirmation requirement.
