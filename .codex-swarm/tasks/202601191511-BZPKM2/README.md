## Summary

Integrated the recipes CLI and docs updates, confirming the end-to-end workflow artifacts are present.

## Context

Closed out tasks for recipes CLI implementation and documentation wiring in direct workflow mode.

## Scope

Validated that recipes.py is implemented, RECIPES.md is wired through AGENTS.md/README/docs, and task records are up to date.

## Risks

No additional risks beyond those captured in the implementation and docs tasks.

## Verify Steps

Confirmed python .codex-swarm/recipes.py --help in CLI task; reviewed docs updates in AGENTS.md/README/docs.

## Rollback Plan

Revert the recipes CLI and documentation commits if integration needs to be undone.

## Notes

Integration complete in direct mode; no branch/worktree merge required.
