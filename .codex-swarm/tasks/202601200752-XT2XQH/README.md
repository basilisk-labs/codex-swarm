description: "Update docs for backend routing (local base + optional Redmine via recipes) and update ORCHESTRATOR to refresh recipe bundles at run start."
---
## Summary

Clarify backend routing and ensure recipes bundle refresh is part of orchestrator startup.

## Context

User wants local backend to remain the base store, with Redmine and other remotes as optional add-ons, plus an orchestrator workflow that refreshes recipe bundles at run start.

## Scope

- Update docs/07 and docs/12 to describe routing and Redmine enable/disable behavior.
- Update ORCHESTRATOR workflow to refresh recipes inventory and bundle.json before execution (with confirmation).

## Risks

Ambiguous wording could lead to tool execution without explicit confirmation.

## Verify Steps

Review docs/07, docs/12, and ORCHESTRATOR.json for accuracy and consistency.

## Rollback Plan

Revert the documentation and workflow changes.

## Notes

No code execution changes beyond documentation updates.
