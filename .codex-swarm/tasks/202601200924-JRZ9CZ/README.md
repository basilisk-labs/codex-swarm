---
## Summary

Document how agents read the global recipes bundle via CLI summary and per-recipe views.

## Context

Agents should have a clear, standard way to discover available recipes and read full recipe docs.

## Scope

- Update AGENTS.md with bundle read guidance.
- Update RECIPES.md with agent-facing usage notes.

## Risks

Docs could imply implicit tool execution; keep explicit confirmation language.

## Verify Steps

Review AGENTS.md and RECIPES.md for accuracy.

## Rollback Plan

Revert documentation changes.
