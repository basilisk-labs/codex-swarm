## Summary

Document the recipe bundle refresh command in RECIPES.md.

## Context

Users need a stable, documented way to refresh bundle.json without manual compile steps.

## Scope

- Add a Bundle refresh section to RECIPES.md.
- Explain refresh behavior and bundle.md update rules.

## Risks

Docs could drift from CLI behavior if examples are inaccurate.

## Verify Steps

Review RECIPES.md for accuracy and English-only wording.

## Rollback Plan

Revert RECIPES.md changes.

## Notes

Keep examples minimal and consistent with recipes.py flags.
