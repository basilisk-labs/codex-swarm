## Summary

Document backend routing and Redmine recipe enable/disable flow.

## Context

Clarify how agentctl routes tasks after Redmine activation and reinforce that the local backend remains the base store and cache.

## Scope

- Update docs/07 to emphasize local base store plus remote optionality.
- Update docs/12 with recipe enable/disable steps and routing flow details.

## Risks

Docs could imply implicit tool execution or confuse canonical vs cache roles.

## Verify Steps

Review docs/07 and docs/12 for accuracy and English-only wording.

## Rollback Plan

Revert the documentation changes.

## Notes

No code or behavior changes.
