description: "Add a new TESTER specialist agent responsible for adding automated test coverage for code changes. Wire the workflow so development-oriented plans always schedule TESTER after CODER before REVIEWER, and update CODER instructions to explicitly hand off to TESTER after implementation/self-check.\\\\n\\\\nAcceptance criteria:\\\\n- New @.AGENTS/TESTER.json exists (id=TESTER) with clear inputs/outputs/permissions/workflow for adding/maintaining tests.\\\\n- @.AGENTS/CODER.json explicitly hands off to TESTER for test coverage after implementation and local checks.\\\\n- @AGENTS.md updates ORCHESTRATOR rules so dev tasks plan CODER -> TESTER -> REVIEWER by default (unless justified).\\\\n- @README.md reflects the new agent in the lineup and repository layout.\\\\n\\\\nNotes:\\\\n- Prefer existing test framework; if none, propose a dedicated task to introduce test infrastructure rather than inventing one ad-hoc."
