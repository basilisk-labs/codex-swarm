description: "Build .codex-swarm/recipes.py with scan/show/compile/explain, manifest normalization, context assembly, and inventory generation per recipes PRD."
---
## Summary

Implemented the recipes CLI with scan/show/compile/explain and bundle generation logic.

## Context

Added .codex-swarm/recipes.py per the recipes PRD and enforced local-only behavior with context policies.

## Scope

CLI supports manifest normalization (v1 + legacy), inventory generation, bundle compilation with context hashing/inline policy, env/input validation, and bundle markdown output; added gitignore rules for run/cache artifacts.

## Risks

Minimal JSON schema validation may diverge from full schema; large context globs could still be slow if include patterns are broad.

## Verify Steps

python .codex-swarm/recipes.py --help

## Rollback Plan

Revert commit b5d407ce6f52 to remove the recipes CLI and related ignore rules.

## Notes

CLI remains non-executing (scan/show/compile/explain only) and enforces no-network, no-task-writes behavior.
