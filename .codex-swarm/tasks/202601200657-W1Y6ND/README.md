---
## Summary

Added the spec-to-tasks recipe to move spec decomposition into recipes and refreshed the recipes inventory.

## Context

Phase 1 migration aims to move planning/decomposition helpers into recipes rather than core logic.

## Scope

Created the spec-to-tasks recipe (manifest, scenario, inputs, runner) and updated docs/recipes-inventory.json via recipes.py scan.

## Risks

Runner uses heuristic parsing of spec sections; complex specs may require manual refinement of the task draft.

## Verify Steps

Ran python .codex-swarm/recipes.py scan --recipes-dir .codex-swarm/recipes --output docs/recipes-inventory.json to refresh the catalog.

## Rollback Plan

Revert commit ce9a0aff3c97 to remove the spec-to-tasks recipe and inventory update.

## Notes

Phase 1 now includes roadmap and spec decomposition recipes; further planning recipes can be added as needed.
