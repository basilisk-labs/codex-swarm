description: "Update orchestrator guidance so it auto-creates the top-level tracking task after plan approval unless the user explicitly opts out; remove the post-approval prompt asking whether to create tasks. Align AGENTS.md, .codex-swarm/agents/ORCHESTRATOR.json, and .codex-swarm/agentctl.md with the new flow."
