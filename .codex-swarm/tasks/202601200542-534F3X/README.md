description: "Update the recipe manifest and runner script to generate a complete roadmap from a top-level task, rename env vars away from CYBOS, and refresh the recipes inventory output."
---
## Summary

Updated the recipe manifest and runner to generate a full roadmap, plus refreshed the recipe inventory output.

## Context

The roadmap recipe needed a real end-to-end runner that emits roadmap, plan, and tasks draft artifacts with RECIPE_* env vars.

## Scope

Updated the manifest outputs and tool env vars; rewrote run-feature.js to generate roadmap markdown, milestones, and task draft; regenerated docs/recipes-inventory.json.

## Risks

The generated roadmap is heuristic and may need manual adjustment for complex tasks; changes to outputs require inventory refresh.

## Verify Steps

Ran python .codex-swarm/recipes.py scan --recipes-dir .codex-swarm/recipes --output docs/recipes-inventory.json; ran the runner with sample inputs to confirm roadmap and artifacts are created.

## Rollback Plan

Revert commit cdb841383165 to restore the previous runner, manifest, and inventory.

## Notes

Runner remains local-only and deterministic with no network access.
