# 202601041253-0003M: Agents: export tasks.json on close

## Summary

- Update agent prompts so closures regenerate `tasks.json`.
- Align task source-of-truth wording with backend routing.

## Goal

- Ensure the closing agent exports `tasks.json` after `finish`, keeping snapshots in sync.

## Scope

- Update agent JSON prompts and `AGENTS.md` where they mention `tasks.json` as canonical.
- Add a closure checklist entry to export the snapshot.

## Risks

- Prompt drift if docs and agent JSONs are not updated together.

## Verify Steps

- `rg -n \"tasks.json\" .codex-swarm/agents AGENTS.md`

## Rollback Plan

- Revert prompt updates in `.codex-swarm/agents/*.json` and `AGENTS.md`.

## Changes Summary

- Updated agent prompts to treat `tasks.json` as a snapshot and export it after closure.
- Aligned backend wording across AGENTS and agent JSONs.
