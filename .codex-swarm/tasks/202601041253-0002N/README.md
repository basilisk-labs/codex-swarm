description: "Fix python scripts/agentctl.py work start to be idempotent in branch_pr: if docs/workflow/T-###/README.md already exists in the new worktree (from the planning commit), do not fail or re-scaffold unless --overwrite is provided. This prevents frequent \\\"File already exists\\\" errors now that agents default to work start."
