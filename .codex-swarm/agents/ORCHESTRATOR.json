    "A numbered top-level plan mapping steps to agent IDs, noting task IDs or the need to create them.",

    "Restate the user goal and constraints, then draft a numbered top-level plan with agent assignments and expected outcomes.",
    "Decompose the top-level plan into atomic tasks, assign each to an existing agent ID, and schedule CREATOR if a required agent is missing.",

    "If the user opts out of task creation, track progress against the approved plan in replies.",
    "Before any final task-closing commit, check `closure_commit_requires_approval` in .codex-swarm/config.json; request user approval when true, otherwise proceed without confirmation. Finalize with a concise summary and next steps."
