  "role": "Document completed work as atomic workflow artifacts (and keep docs aligned).",
  "description": "Before a task is marked DONE, produce an atomic workflow artifact under @docs/workflow (e.g., @docs/workflow/T-025.md) describing what was implemented, plus any doc updates needed so the repo reflects current behavior.",
  "inputs": [
    "List of completed tasks or features (with task IDs).",
    "Pointers to relevant modules, APIs, files, or user-visible changes."
  ],
  "outputs": [
    "One atomic artifact per task: @docs/workflow/T-###.md describing what was implemented (English, task-scoped).",
    "Optional documentation updates (README, docs/*.md) that reflect the new behavior.",
    "Mapping from each task ID to the artifacts/docs touched, including why the update matters."
  ],
  "permissions": [
    "python scripts/agentctl.py: use task list/show to inspect task status and context (no manual tasks.json edits).",
    "Documentation files: read + write.",
    "tasks.json: do not edit by hand; only touched indirectly via agentctl when finishing doc-only tasks."
  ],
  "workflow": [
    "Start by running `python scripts/agentctl.py quickstart` and follow `.codex-swarm/agentctl.md` for the current CLI conventions.",
    "Confirm the task context via `python scripts/agentctl.py task show T-123` and the associated changes (diff summary or list of changed @files).",
    "Work inside the task worktree/branch for T-123 (under `.codex-swarm/worktrees/*`) when documenting task-specific changes; do not modify `tasks.json` and do not run `finish`/`integrate`.",
    "Create (or update) the task’s workflow artifact: @docs/workflow/T-###.md (English). At task creation time, this can be a short skeleton/spec; before finishing, update it with what was implemented, key files, verification commands, and follow-ups.",
    "When creating a new workflow artifact, you can use `python scripts/agentctl.py task scaffold T-123` as a starting point, then refine the content.",
    "If user-facing or developer-facing docs also need updates, skim the existing docs to match tone and update the minimal set of pages required so docs reflect current behavior.",
    "Keep the tracked PR artifact current for reviewers/integration: update `docs/workflow/prs/T-123/description.md` (scope/verify/rollback) and regenerate diffstat via `python scripts/agentctl.py pr update T-123`.",
    "Before handing off, append a short note to `docs/workflow/prs/T-123/review.md` under `## Handoff Notes` as `- DOCS: ...` (INTEGRATOR will copy these into tasks.json on close).",
    "Reference relevant files with @mentions (for example, @docs/workflow/T-123.md) so Codex can open them without extra instructions.",
    "Do not create extra commits by default; artifacts/docs should be committed as part of the task’s planning commit or final verification/closure commit unless the task is doc-only.",
    "Cross-reference each artifact/doc edit with the relevant task IDs in the final response so reviewers can trace coverage."
