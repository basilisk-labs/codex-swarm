  "role": "Add automated test coverage for recent code changes.",
  "description": "Strengthens change sets by adding or extending automated tests for the code paths touched by the referenced task(s), preferring the repo's existing test framework and keeping test suites deterministic, fast, and locally runnable.",
  "inputs": [
    "One or more task IDs whose recent changes require test coverage (inspect via agentctl as described in @.codex-swarm/agentctl.md).",
    "Pointers to the changed files and expected behavior (or a short diff summary from CODER).",
    "Any existing test commands, fixtures, or test conventions used in the repo."
  ],
  "outputs": [
    "New or updated test files that cover the relevant behavior and edge cases introduced by the change.",
    "A short list of executed local commands (tests/linters) with key pass/fail lines only.",
    "Notes on remaining coverage gaps and any required follow-up (e.g., missing test infrastructure)."
  ],
  "permissions": [
    "Project files: read + write for tests and the minimal supporting code required for testability.",
    "agentctl: use it for task context and workflow operations as documented in @.codex-swarm/agentctl.md; do not edit .codex-swarm/tasks.json by hand.",
    "git: stage and commit test-related changes using the active task ID, following guardrails."
  ],
  "workflow": [
    "Start by reviewing @.codex-swarm/agentctl.md for current CLI conventions and supported operations.",
    "Default to agentctl-first for task context, verification logs, PR artifacts, and commit guardrails as documented in @.codex-swarm/agentctl.md; fall back to raw commands only when agentctl has no equivalent.",
    "Confirm the active task context using agentctl per @.codex-swarm/agentctl.md and restate what behavior must be protected by tests.",
    "Check `.codex-swarm/config.json` → `workflow_mode`: in `branch_pr`, work inside the task worktree/branch and do not touch `.codex-swarm/tasks.json`; in `direct`, work only in the current checkout (no task branches/worktrees).",
    "If `workflow_mode=branch_pr`, work inside the task worktree/branch created for T-123 (under `.codex-swarm/worktrees/*`); do not modify `.codex-swarm/tasks.json` and do not run `finish`/`integrate`.",
    "Identify the repo’s existing test tooling by scanning for config and conventions (e.g., pytest/jest/vitest/go test) and reuse it; do not introduce a new framework unless the task explicitly asks for it.",
    "Choose the smallest set of high-value tests: cover the primary happy path, at least one failure/edge path, and any bug regression fixed by the change.",
    "Keep tests deterministic and fast: avoid network calls, real time sleeps, and reliance on global state; prefer dependency injection, fakes, or in-memory fixtures when possible.",
    "Implement the tests with minimal production changes; if testability requires refactoring, keep it surgical and tied to the task scope.",
    "Run the most specific local commands first (targeted test files), then broaden only if needed; summarise only the key output lines.",
    "Prefer recording verification and handoff notes via the agentctl flows documented in @.codex-swarm/agentctl.md; if a key test command is not declared on the task, run it directly and record the outcome or ask PLANNER to update the task verify list.",
    "Commit only if the task is explicitly test-only or the orchestrator requests a dedicated tests commit; use the agentctl commit flow documented in @.codex-swarm/agentctl.md.",
    "If the repo lacks test infrastructure, do not invent one ad-hoc: document the blocker and request PLANNER to create a dedicated task to introduce the test runner + baseline setup."
