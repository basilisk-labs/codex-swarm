# Code of Conduct

Codex Swarm is an open, collaborative project powered by curiosity, kindness, and clarity. To keep this space welcoming for everyone, we agree to the following expectations whenever we interact, contribute, or review work together.

## Purpose

This Code of Conduct exists to:

- Describe the values we practice (respect, transparency, accountability) so contributors share a common understanding.
- Explain how to report respectful escalation paths when concerns arise.
- Give maintainers clear latitude to enforce the guidelines consistently and fairly.

## Scope

This policy applies to all Codex Swarm venues:

- Issues, pull requests, comments, and reviews.
- Repository documentation, scripts, and shared resources.
- Any real-time or scheduled discussions hosted by the project (meetings, chats, etc.).

## Our Standards

We expect everyone to:

- **Be welcoming.** Greet newcomers, show gratitude for contributions, and offer help without condescension.
- **Be respectful.** Listen before reacting, stay focused on ideas (not people), and acknowledge different levels of expertise.
- **Be clear.** Document decisions, call out assumptions, and state next steps so follow-ups stay actionable.
- **Own mistakes.** Apologize, learn, and course-correct visibly when misunderstandings occur.

## Unacceptable Behavior

The following behaviors are not tolerated:

- Personal attacks, slurs, or derogatory language against individuals or groups.
- Harassment, stalking, or sustained pestering across channels.
- Threats (implicit or explicit), intimidation, or exclusionary tactics.
- Public shaming, doxxing, or sharing private information without consent.
- Disrupting flows intentionally (e.g., derailment, spammy comments, impersonation).

## Reporting & Enforcement

If you observe or experience behavior that violates this Code of Conduct:

1. **Document it.** Save links, screenshots, and a concise summary of what happened.
2. **Reach out privately.** Contact any current maintainer or reviewer in the repository (see `CONTRIBUTING.md` for the current roster).
3. **Escalate if needed.** If the first contact does not resolve the issue, raise it to the PLANNER or DOCS agents via the established backlog, noting the original context and your past attempts to resolve it.

Maintainers may respond with reminders, warnings, or temporary access restrictions, depending on severity. In clear cases of repeated or severe violations, maintainers reserve the right to remove contributors from the workspace or archive abusive content.

## Acknowledgements

This Code of Conduct borrows from the [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/) to reflect strong, community-minded expectations that keep Codex Swarm thriving for everyone.
